# Consumption Time Series

The Consumption Time Series analysis provides a comprehensive view of energy delivery patterns for a selected asset and its downstream network. It helps engineers and planners understand **how much energy** is flowing, **when** peak demand occurs, and **how weather** influences loading.

## Opening the Analysis

1. Click a node on the map to select it.
2. Click the **bar chart icon** (📊) in the analytics toolbar.
3. The analysis window opens and queries downstream meter readings for the selected date range.

## Understanding the Charts

The window contains three charts, each providing a different analytical perspective:

---

### 1. Consumption Time-Series (Full Period)

**What it shows:** Daily aggregate energy delivery (kWh) across the selected time range, overlaid with a 24-hour rolling average ambient temperature curve.

**How to read it:**
- **Blue bars** represent the total kWh delivered each interval (typically daily)
- **Red line** shows the ambient temperature (°C) on the right Y-axis
- A **zoom slider** at the bottom lets you focus on any sub-range without re-querying

**Value it provides:**
- Spot **demand spikes** that may indicate equipment stress or new large loads
- Correlate consumption **increases with cold snaps** (heating load) or **heat waves** (cooling load)
- Identify **unusual drops** that could signal outages, meter failures, or switching events
- Detect **seasonal trends** to forecast future capacity needs

---

### 2. Typical Daily Load Profile (Hourly Avg)

**What it shows:** The average hourly consumption pattern across all days in the selected range.

**How to read it:**
- The **orange curve** represents the mean kWh consumption for each hour of the day (0:00 – 23:00)
- The X-axis is hour-of-day; the Y-axis is average kWh

**Value it provides:**
- Reveals the **diurnal pattern** — when the network is most and least loaded
- Identifies **morning ramp-up** and **evening peak** demand windows
- Helps utilities schedule **maintenance windows** during low-demand periods
- Useful for sizing **battery storage** or **demand response programs** by understanding off-peak surplus

---

### 3. Load vs Temperature Correlation (Scatter)

**What it shows:** A scatter plot of consumption vs. ambient temperature, with seasonal target markers.

**How to read it:**
- Each **blue dot** represents a single time interval's kWh delivery plotted against temperature
- **Winter Target** (left marker, e.g., −5°C) and **Summer Target** (right marker, e.g., 30°C) show labeled design-day references
- The shape of the scatter reveals the **heating/cooling sensitivity** of the circuit

**Value it provides:**
- Quantifies how **temperature-sensitive** a circuit is — steeper slopes mean more weather-dependent load
- Helps identify the **balance point** temperature where heating/cooling loads are minimal
- Enables **design-day forecasting** — extrapolate what consumption would be at extreme temperatures
- Detects **anomalous outliers** — points far from the main cluster may indicate data quality issues or unusual events

## Filters

Click the **Filters** button in the title bar to adjust:
- **Degrees of Separation** — controls how many hops downstream from the selected node are included in the query
- **Date Range** — use the quick-select buttons (1W, 1M, 1Y) or configure globally in settings

## Tips

- **Large queries**: When the estimated row count exceeds the threshold, the window will pause and ask for confirmation before proceeding
- **Multi-asset aggregate**: Select multiple nodes (Shift+Click) to see aggregated consumption across assets
- **Drag & resize**: Position the window anywhere on screen; it remembers its last position

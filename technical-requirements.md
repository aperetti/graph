# Technical Requirements: Grid-Scale Analytical Agent

## 1. Architecture & Design
* **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Organize code by feature (vertical slices) rather than technical layers. A single file NEVER handles more than one responsibility.
* **File Structure**: Must propose a file structure following Vertical Slice Architecture before writing any code.

## 2. Infrastructure & Data Storage
* **Database**: DuckDB must be used as the database, overriding global rule #4. Time-series and cold data should use Parquet format.
* **Grid Model Graph**: Python with NetworkX (or similar).

## 3. Interactive Visual Grid
*   **Visualization (Frontend)**:
    *   **Library:** Deck.gl for rendering the interactive grid topology map using geospatial coordinates.
    *   **Features:** Interactive node clicking, context menu (right-click) for node-specific actions, geospatial zooming, panning.
    *   **Data Fetching:** Standard `fetch` API against FastAPI REST endpoints.
    *   **Rendering Taxonomy:** Switches must be rendered as squares. Open switches should be transparent/hollow; closed switches must be filled.

*   **Backend (FastAPI & Data Ingestion)**:
    *   **Data Ingestion (CIM):** The CIM ingestor must effectively extract robust asset taxonomy, correctly tagging `Substation`, `Breaker`, `Switch`, `Transformer`, and `Meter` types. Determine the switch 'open' status for visualizations.
    *   **Graph Export Endpoint:** An endpoint to export the full grid (or a simplified version) as JSON (nodes and links) for the frontend visualization library.
    *   **Time Series Endpoints:** Endpoints to fetch consumption metrics must support dynamic start/end ISO strings to fulfill UI ranges (1W, 1M, 1Y).
    *   Existing Endpoints: Re-use `/api/analytics/phase-balance/{node_id}` to calculate the downstream aggregations upon node click.
    *   **Synthetic AMI Generation:** Generate synthetic AMI time-series metrics traversing from 2025 through 2027.
    *   **Alarms Dataset Integration**:
        *   **Relational Storage**: Active alarms and metadata stored in a dedicated `alarms` table in DuckDB.
        *   **Log Storage**: Historical alarm logs should be stored in Parquet format in `cim_alarms/` directory for high-performance temporal queries.

## 4. Technology Stack
* **Language**: Python
* **Environment**: Developed and deployed via Anti-gravity IDE.
* **Libraries**: Minimize the number of external libraries. Use only well-established libraries that will be supported long-term.

## 4. Environment Configuration
* **Port Mapping**: Docker Compose services must use environment variables for host port mapping with sensible defaults:
    * `BACKEND_PORT`: Default `8000`
    * `FRONTEND_PORT`: Default `8080`
    * `WEBSITE_PORT`: Default `3000`

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Always follow TDD best practices.
* **Unit/Functional Tests**: Always create and memorialize functionality in unit or functional tests.
